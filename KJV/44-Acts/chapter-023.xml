		<verse num="1">And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</verse>
		<verse num="2">And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</verse>
		<verse num="4">And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?</verse>
		<verse num="5">Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</verse>
		<verse num="6">But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</verse>
		<verse num="7">And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.</verse>
		<verse num="8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.</verse>
		<verse num="9">And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</verse>
		<verse num="10">And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.</verse>
		<verse num="11">And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</verse>
		<verse num="12">And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</verse>
		<verse num="13">And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.</verse>
		<verse num="14">And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.</verse>
		<verse num="16">And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.</verse>
		<verse num="17">Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</verse>
		<verse num="18">So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?</verse>
		<verse num="20">And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.</verse>
		<verse num="21">But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</verse>
		<verse num="22">So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</verse>
		<verse num="23">And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;</verse>
		<verse num="24">And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.</verse>
		<verse num="25">And he wrote a letter after this manner:</verse>
		<verse num="26">Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.</verse>
		<verse num="27">This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</verse>
		<verse num="28">And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:</verse>
		<verse num="29">Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</verse>
		<verse num="30">And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.</verse>
		<verse num="31">Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.</verse>
		<verse num="32">On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</verse>
		<verse num="33">Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</verse>
		<verse num="34">And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;</verse>
		<verse num="35">I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.</verse>
