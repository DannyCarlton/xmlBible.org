		<verse num="1">Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.</verse>
		<verse num="2">He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</verse>
		<verse num="3">And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?</verse>
		<verse num="4">Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</verse>
		<verse num="6">Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.</verse>
		<verse num="7">For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;</verse>
		<verse num="9">Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</verse>
		<verse num="10">But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?</verse>
		<verse num="11">As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:</verse>
		<verse num="12">So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</verse>
		<verse num="13">O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</verse>
		<verse num="14">If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.</verse>
		<verse num="16">For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?</verse>
		<verse num="17">My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.</verse>
		<verse num="18">And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.</verse>
		<verse num="19">The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</verse>
		<verse num="21">His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.</verse>
		<verse num="22">But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.</verse>
