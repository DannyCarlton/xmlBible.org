		<verse num="1">Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?</verse>
		<verse num="2">Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.</verse>
		<verse num="3">They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.</verse>
		<verse num="4">They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.</verse>
		<verse num="6">They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.</verse>
		<verse num="7">They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.</verse>
		<verse num="8">They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</verse>
		<verse num="9">They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.</verse>
		<verse num="10">They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;</verse>
		<verse num="11">Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.</verse>
		<verse num="13">They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</verse>
		<verse num="14">The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.</verse>
		<verse num="15">The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.</verse>
		<verse num="16">In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.</verse>
		<verse num="17">For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.</verse>
		<verse num="18">He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.</verse>
		<verse num="20">The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.</verse>
		<verse num="21">He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.</verse>
		<verse num="22">He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.</verse>
		<verse num="23">Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.</verse>
		<verse num="24">They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</verse>
		<verse num="25">And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?</verse>
