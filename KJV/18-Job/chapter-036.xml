		<verse num="1">Elihu also proceeded, and said,</verse>
		<verse num="2">Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.</verse>
		<verse num="3">I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</verse>
		<verse num="4">For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</verse>
		<verse num="6">He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</verse>
		<verse num="7">He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</verse>
		<verse num="8">And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;</verse>
		<verse num="9">Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</verse>
		<verse num="10">He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</verse>
		<verse num="11">If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</verse>
		<verse num="12">But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</verse>
		<verse num="13">But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</verse>
		<verse num="14">They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</verse>
		<verse num="15">He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.</verse>
		<verse num="17">But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.</verse>
		<verse num="18">Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</verse>
		<verse num="22">Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</verse>
		<verse num="23">Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</verse>
		<verse num="24">Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</verse>
		<verse num="25">Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</verse>
		<verse num="26">Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</verse>
		<verse num="27">For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</verse>
		<verse num="28">Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.</verse>
		<verse num="29">Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?</verse>
		<verse num="30">Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</verse>
		<verse num="31">For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</verse>
		<verse num="32">With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.</verse>
		<verse num="33">The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.</verse>
