	<chapter num="41">
		<verse num="1">Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?</verse>
		<verse num="2">Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?</verse>
		<verse num="3">Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?</verse>
		<verse num="4">Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?</verse>
		<verse num="5">Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</verse>
		<verse num="6">Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?</verse>
		<verse num="7">Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?</verse>
		<verse num="8">Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</verse>
		<verse num="10">None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?</verse>
		<verse num="11">Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.</verse>
		<verse num="12">I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?</verse>
		<verse num="14">Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.</verse>
		<verse num="15">His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.</verse>
		<verse num="16">One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</verse>
		<verse num="17">They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</verse>
		<verse num="18">By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.</verse>
		<verse num="21">His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</verse>
		<verse num="22">In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</verse>
		<verse num="23">The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</verse>
		<verse num="24">His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.</verse>
		<verse num="25">When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</verse>
		<verse num="26">The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</verse>
		<verse num="27">He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</verse>
		<verse num="28">The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</verse>
		<verse num="29">Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</verse>
		<verse num="30">Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</verse>
		<verse num="31">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</verse>
		<verse num="32">He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</verse>
		<verse num="33">Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</verse>
		<verse num="34">He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.</verse>
