		<verse num="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</verse>
		<verse num="2">If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</verse>
		<verse num="3">Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</verse>
		<verse num="5">But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</verse>
		<verse num="7">Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</verse>
		<verse num="8">Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</verse>
		<verse num="9">By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</verse>
		<verse num="10">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
		<verse num="11">The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</verse>
		<verse num="13">In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</verse>
		<verse num="14">Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</verse>
		<verse num="16">It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</verse>
		<verse num="17">Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</verse>
		<verse num="18">Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</verse>
		<verse num="19">How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</verse>
		<verse num="20">They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</verse>
