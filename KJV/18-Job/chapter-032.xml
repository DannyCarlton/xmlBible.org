		<verse num="1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</verse>
		<verse num="5">When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</verse>
		<verse num="6">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</verse>
		<verse num="7">I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</verse>
		<verse num="8">But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:</verse>
		<verse num="13">Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</verse>
		<verse num="15">They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</verse>
		<verse num="16">When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)</verse>
		<verse num="17">I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</verse>
		<verse num="18">For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</verse>
		<verse num="20">I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</verse>
		<verse num="22">For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.</verse>
