		<verse num="1">Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</verse>
		<verse num="3">My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</verse>
		<verse num="4">The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</verse>
		<verse num="5">If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,</verse>
		<verse num="9">I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</verse>
		<verse num="11">He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</verse>
		<verse num="14">For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</verse>
		<verse num="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</verse>
		<verse num="16">Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</verse>
		<verse num="17">That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</verse>
		<verse num="18">He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</verse>
		<verse num="19">He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:</verse>
		<verse num="20">So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</verse>
		<verse num="21">His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</verse>
		<verse num="22">Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</verse>
		<verse num="23">If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</verse>
		<verse num="24">Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</verse>
		<verse num="25">His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:</verse>
		<verse num="26">He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</verse>
		<verse num="27">He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</verse>
		<verse num="28">He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</verse>
		<verse num="29">Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,</verse>
		<verse num="30">To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</verse>
		<verse num="31">Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</verse>
		<verse num="32">If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</verse>
		<verse num="33">If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</verse>
