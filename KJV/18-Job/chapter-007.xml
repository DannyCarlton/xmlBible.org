		<verse num="1">Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?</verse>
		<verse num="2">As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:</verse>
		<verse num="3">So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</verse>
		<verse num="4">When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</verse>
		<verse num="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</verse>
		<verse num="6">My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</verse>
		<verse num="7">O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</verse>
		<verse num="8">The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</verse>
		<verse num="9">As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.</verse>
		<verse num="10">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</verse>
		<verse num="13">When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;</verse>
		<verse num="14">Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</verse>
		<verse num="15">So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.</verse>
		<verse num="16">I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</verse>
		<verse num="17">What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</verse>
		<verse num="18">And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</verse>
		<verse num="19">How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</verse>
		<verse num="20">I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</verse>
		<verse num="21">And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</verse>
