		<verse num="1">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</verse>
		<verse num="2">Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?</verse>
		<verse num="3">Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</verse>
		<verse num="4">For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.</verse>
		<verse num="5">But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;</verse>
		<verse num="6">And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</verse>
		<verse num="8">It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?</verse>
		<verse num="9">The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</verse>
		<verse num="10">If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?</verse>
		<verse num="11">For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?</verse>
		<verse num="12">For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.</verse>
		<verse num="13">If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;</verse>
		<verse num="14">If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</verse>
		<verse num="15">For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:</verse>
		<verse num="16">Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:</verse>
		<verse num="17">And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</verse>
		<verse num="18">And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</verse>
		<verse num="20">But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.</verse>
