		<verse num="1">My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?</verse>
		<verse num="3">Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?</verse>
		<verse num="4">For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.</verse>
		<verse num="5">He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.</verse>
		<verse num="6">He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.</verse>
		<verse num="9">The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</verse>
		<verse num="10">But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.</verse>
		<verse num="11">My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.</verse>
		<verse num="12">They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.</verse>
		<verse num="13">If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.</verse>
		<verse num="14">I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.</verse>
		<verse num="15">And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?</verse>
		<verse num="16">They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.</verse>
