		<verse num="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
		<verse num="2">Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!</verse>
		<verse num="4">I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</verse>
		<verse num="5">I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.</verse>
		<verse num="7">There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</verse>
		<verse num="9">On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:</verse>
		<verse num="10">But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</verse>
		<verse num="11">My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</verse>
		<verse num="13">But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.</verse>
		<verse num="14">For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</verse>
		<verse num="16">For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</verse>
		<verse num="17">Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.</verse>
