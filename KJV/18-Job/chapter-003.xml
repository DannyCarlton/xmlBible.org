		<verse num="1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
		<verse num="2">And Job spake, and said,</verse>
		<verse num="3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
		<verse num="6">As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</verse>
		<verse num="10">Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</verse>
		<verse num="12">Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</verse>
		<verse num="13">For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</verse>
		<verse num="14">With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;</verse>
		<verse num="15">Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</verse>
		<verse num="16">Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</verse>
		<verse num="17">There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</verse>
		<verse num="18">There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</verse>
		<verse num="19">The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</verse>
		<verse num="21">Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
		<verse num="22">Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</verse>
		<verse num="23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</verse>
		<verse num="24">For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</verse>
		<verse num="25">For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</verse>
		<verse num="26">I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</verse>
