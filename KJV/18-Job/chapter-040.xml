		<verse num="1">Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,</verse>
		<verse num="2">Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</verse>
		<verse num="4">Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</verse>
		<verse num="7">Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</verse>
		<verse num="9">Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</verse>
		<verse num="10">Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.</verse>
		<verse num="17">He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.</verse>
		<verse num="18">His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.</verse>
		<verse num="19">He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</verse>
		<verse num="21">He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</verse>
		<verse num="22">The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</verse>
		<verse num="23">Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</verse>
		<verse num="24">He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.</verse>
