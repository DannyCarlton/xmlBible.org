		<verse num="1">And Job answered and said,</verse>
		<verse num="2">No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</verse>
		<verse num="3">But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?</verse>
		<verse num="4">I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.</verse>
		<verse num="5">He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.</verse>
		<verse num="6">The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.</verse>
		<verse num="7">But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:</verse>
		<verse num="8">Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?</verse>
		<verse num="10">In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?</verse>
		<verse num="12">With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.</verse>
		<verse num="13">With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="16">With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.</verse>
		<verse num="17">He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.</verse>
		<verse num="18">He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.</verse>
		<verse num="19">He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.</verse>
		<verse num="20">He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.</verse>
		<verse num="21">He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.</verse>
		<verse num="22">He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</verse>
		<verse num="23">He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.</verse>
		<verse num="24">He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.</verse>
		<verse num="25">They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.</verse>
