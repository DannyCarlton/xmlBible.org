		<verse num="1">Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</verse>
		<verse num="2">Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?</verse>
		<verse num="3">Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</verse>
		<verse num="4">Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</verse>
		<verse num="5">For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?</verse>
		<verse num="8">Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?</verse>
		<verse num="9">What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?</verse>
		<verse num="10">With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?</verse>
		<verse num="12">Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,</verse>
		<verse num="13">That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?</verse>
		<verse num="14">What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</verse>
		<verse num="15">Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</verse>
		<verse num="16">How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?</verse>
		<verse num="17">I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;</verse>
		<verse num="18">Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:</verse>
		<verse num="19">Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</verse>
		<verse num="20">The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</verse>
		<verse num="21">A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</verse>
		<verse num="22">He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</verse>
		<verse num="23">He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</verse>
		<verse num="24">Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</verse>
		<verse num="25">For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</verse>
		<verse num="26">He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:</verse>
		<verse num="27">Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.</verse>
		<verse num="28">And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</verse>
		<verse num="29">He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="30">He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</verse>
		<verse num="31">Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.</verse>
		<verse num="32">It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</verse>
		<verse num="33">He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</verse>
		<verse num="34">For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</verse>
		<verse num="35">They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</verse>
