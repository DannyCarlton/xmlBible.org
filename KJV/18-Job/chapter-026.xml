		<verse num="1">But Job answered and said,</verse>
		<verse num="2">How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?</verse>
		<verse num="3">How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?</verse>
		<verse num="4">To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?</verse>
		<verse num="5">Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</verse>
		<verse num="7">He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.</verse>
		<verse num="8">He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.</verse>
		<verse num="9">He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.</verse>
		<verse num="10">He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.</verse>
		<verse num="11">The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</verse>
		<verse num="12">He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.</verse>
		<verse num="13">By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?</verse>
