		<verse num="1">Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</verse>
		<verse num="2">For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</verse>
		<verse num="3">They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</verse>
		<verse num="4">For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.</verse>
		<verse num="5">And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</verse>
		<verse num="7">When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Let his days be few; and let another take his office.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</verse>
		<verse num="17">As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</verse>
		<verse num="18">As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</verse>
		<verse num="21">But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.</verse>
		<verse num="22">For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</verse>
		<verse num="23">I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</verse>
		<verse num="24">My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</verse>
		<verse num="25">I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</verse>
		<verse num="26">Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</verse>
		<verse num="27">That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.</verse>
		<verse num="28">Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</verse>
		<verse num="29">Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</verse>
		<verse num="30">I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</verse>
		<verse num="31">For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.</verse>
