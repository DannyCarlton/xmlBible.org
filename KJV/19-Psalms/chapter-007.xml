		<verse num="1">O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:</verse>
		<verse num="2">Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</verse>
		<verse num="3">O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;</verse>
		<verse num="4">If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)</verse>
		<verse num="5">Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.</verse>
		<verse num="7">So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.</verse>
		<verse num="8">The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.</verse>
		<verse num="10">My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.</verse>
		<verse num="11">God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.</verse>
		<verse num="12">If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</verse>
		<verse num="13">He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</verse>
		<verse num="15">He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.</verse>
		<verse num="16">His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.</verse>
		<verse num="17">I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.</verse>
