		<verse num="1">Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.</verse>

		<verse num="3">Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.</verse>
		<verse num="6">When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="8">But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.</verse>
