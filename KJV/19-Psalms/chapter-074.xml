		<verse num="1">O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</verse>
		<verse num="2">Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.</verse>
		<verse num="5">A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.</verse>

		<verse num="7">They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.</verse>
		<verse num="8">They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</verse>
		<verse num="9">We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.</verse>
		<verse num="10">O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?</verse>

		<verse num="12">For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</verse>

		<verse num="14">Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.</verse>
		<verse num="16">The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.</verse>
		<verse num="17">Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.</verse>
		<verse num="18">Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.</verse>
		<verse num="19">O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</verse>
		<verse num="21">O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.</verse>
		<verse num="22">Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.</verse>
		<verse num="23">Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.</verse>
