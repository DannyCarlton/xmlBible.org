		<verse num="1">Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?</verse>
		<verse num="3">Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</verse>
		<verse num="5">That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</verse>
		<verse num="6">We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</verse>
		<verse num="9">He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</verse>
		<verse num="10">And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</verse>
		<verse num="11">And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</verse>
		<verse num="13">They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</verse>
		<verse num="14">But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</verse>
		<verse num="15">And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</verse>
		<verse num="16">They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.</verse>
		<verse num="17">The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.</verse>
		<verse num="18">And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</verse>
		<verse num="19">They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</verse>
		<verse num="21">They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</verse>
		<verse num="22">Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.</verse>
		<verse num="23">Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</verse>
		<verse num="24">Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</verse>
		<verse num="25">But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</verse>
		<verse num="26">Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</verse>
		<verse num="27">To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</verse>
		<verse num="28">They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</verse>
		<verse num="29">Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</verse>
		<verse num="30">Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.</verse>
		<verse num="31">And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</verse>
		<verse num="32">They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</verse>
		<verse num="33">Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</verse>
		<verse num="34">They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</verse>
		<verse num="35">But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</verse>
		<verse num="36">And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</verse>
		<verse num="37">Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</verse>
		<verse num="38">And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</verse>
		<verse num="39">Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</verse>
		<verse num="40">Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</verse>
		<verse num="41">And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</verse>
		<verse num="42">Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</verse>
		<verse num="43">Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</verse>
		<verse num="44">Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</verse>
		<verse num="45">And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</verse>
		<verse num="46">He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</verse>
		<verse num="47">Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</verse>
		<verse num="48">Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</verse>
