		<verse num="1">Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:</verse>
		<verse num="2">My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.</verse>
		<verse num="3">LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!</verse>
		<verse num="4">Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;</verse>
		<verse num="8">Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</verse>
		<verse num="9">I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.</verse>
		<verse num="10">It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:</verse>
		<verse num="12">That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:</verse>
		<verse num="13">That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:</verse>
		<verse num="14">That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.</verse>
