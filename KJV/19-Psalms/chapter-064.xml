	<chapter num="64">
		<verse num="1">Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:</verse>
		<verse num="3">Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:</verse>
		<verse num="4">That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.</verse>
		<verse num="5">They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?</verse>
		<verse num="6">They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.</verse>
		<verse num="7">But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.</verse>
		<verse num="8">So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.</verse>
		<verse num="9">And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.</verse>
		<verse num="10">The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.</verse>
