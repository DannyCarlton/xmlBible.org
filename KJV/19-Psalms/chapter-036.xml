		<verse num="1">The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.</verse>
		<verse num="2">For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.</verse>
		<verse num="3">The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.</verse>
		<verse num="4">He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.</verse>
		<verse num="7">How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.</verse>
		<verse num="8">They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</verse>
		<verse num="9">For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.</verse>
		<verse num="10">O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.</verse>
