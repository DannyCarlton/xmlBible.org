		<verse num="1">O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</verse>
		<verse num="2">For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.</verse>
		<verse num="3">There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.</verse>
		<verse num="4">For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</verse>
		<verse num="5">My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.</verse>
		<verse num="6">I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</verse>
		<verse num="7">For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.</verse>
		<verse num="8">I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</verse>
		<verse num="10">My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</verse>
		<verse num="11">My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</verse>
		<verse num="12">They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.</verse>
		<verse num="13">But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.</verse>
		<verse num="15">For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.</verse>
		<verse num="16">For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.</verse>
		<verse num="17">For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.</verse>
		<verse num="18">For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</verse>
		<verse num="19">But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</verse>
		<verse num="20">They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.</verse>
		<verse num="22">Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.</verse>
