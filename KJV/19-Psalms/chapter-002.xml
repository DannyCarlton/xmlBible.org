		<verse num="1">Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</verse>
		<verse num="2">The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,</verse>
		<verse num="3">Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</verse>
		<verse num="4">He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</verse>
		<verse num="7">I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</verse>
