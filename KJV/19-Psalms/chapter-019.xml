		<verse num="1">The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.</verse>
		<verse num="3">There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,</verse>
		<verse num="5">Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.</verse>
		<verse num="6">His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</verse>
		<verse num="7">The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.</verse>
		<verse num="8">The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.</verse>
		<verse num="9">The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.</verse>
		<verse num="10">More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.</verse>
