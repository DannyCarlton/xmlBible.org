		<verse num="1">Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?</verse>
		<verse num="2">The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</verse>
		<verse num="3">For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.</verse>
		<verse num="4">The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.</verse>
		<verse num="5">His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.</verse>
		<verse num="6">He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.</verse>
		<verse num="7">His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.</verse>
		<verse num="8">He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.</verse>
		<verse num="9">He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.</verse>
		<verse num="10">He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.</verse>
		<verse num="11">He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.</verse>
		<verse num="16">The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.</verse>
		<verse num="17">LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:</verse>
		<verse num="18">To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.</verse>
