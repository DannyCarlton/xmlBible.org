		<verse num="1">In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</verse>
		<verse num="5">For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.</verse>
		<verse num="6">By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.</verse>
		<verse num="7">I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.</verse>
		<verse num="10">For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,</verse>
		<verse num="11">Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.</verse>
		<verse num="12">O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.</verse>
		<verse num="14">But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.</verse>
		<verse num="15">My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.</verse>
		<verse num="16">I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.</verse>
		<verse num="17">O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.</verse>
		<verse num="18">Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!</verse>
		<verse num="20">Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.</verse>
		<verse num="22">I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.</verse>
		<verse num="23">My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.</verse>
		<verse num="24">My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.</verse>
