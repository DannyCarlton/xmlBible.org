		<verse num="1">Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.</verse>
		<verse num="2">O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;</verse>
		<verse num="3">But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</verse>
		<verse num="5">The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.</verse>
		<verse num="6">The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.</verse>
		<verse num="7">I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.</verse>
		<verse num="8">I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.</verse>

		<verse num="11">Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</verse>
