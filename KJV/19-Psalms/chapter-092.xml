		<verse num="1">IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:</verse>
		<verse num="2">To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,</verse>
		<verse num="3">Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.</verse>
		<verse num="4">For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.</verse>
		<verse num="5">O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.</verse>
		<verse num="6">A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.</verse>
		<verse num="7">When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:</verse>
		<verse num="8">But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.</verse>
		<verse num="9">For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</verse>
		<verse num="10">But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.</verse>
		<verse num="12">The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.</verse>
		<verse num="14">They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;</verse>
		<verse num="15">To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</verse>
