		<verse num="1">By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.</verse>
		<verse num="2">We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.</verse>

		<verse num="4">How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?</verse>
		<verse num="5">If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.</verse>
		<verse num="6">If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.</verse>
		<verse num="8">O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.</verse>
