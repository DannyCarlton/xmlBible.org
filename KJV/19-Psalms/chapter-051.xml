		<verse num="3">For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.</verse>

		<verse num="19">Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.</verse>
