		<verse num="1">O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;</verse>
		<verse num="2">To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.</verse>
		<verse num="5">My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:</verse>
		<verse num="6">When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.</verse>
		<verse num="8">My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.</verse>
		<verse num="9">But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="10">They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.</verse>
		<verse num="11">But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.</verse>
