	<chapter num="89">
		<verse num="1">I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.</verse>
		<verse num="2">For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.</verse>
		<verse num="3">I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,</verse>
		<verse num="4">Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.</verse>
		<verse num="5">And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.</verse>
		<verse num="6">For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?</verse>
		<verse num="7">God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.</verse>
		<verse num="8">O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?</verse>
		<verse num="9">Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.</verse>
		<verse num="11">The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.</verse>
		<verse num="12">The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.</verse>
		<verse num="16">In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.</verse>
		<verse num="17">For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.</verse>
		<verse num="18">For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.</verse>
		<verse num="20">I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:</verse>
		<verse num="21">With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.</verse>
		<verse num="22">The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.</verse>
		<verse num="23">And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.</verse>
		<verse num="24">But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</verse>
		<verse num="25">I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.</verse>
		<verse num="26">He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.</verse>
		<verse num="27">Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="28">My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.</verse>
		<verse num="29">His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.</verse>
		<verse num="30">If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;</verse>
		<verse num="31">If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;</verse>
		<verse num="32">Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</verse>
		<verse num="33">Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</verse>
		<verse num="34">My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</verse>
		<verse num="35">Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.</verse>
		<verse num="36">His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.</verse>
		<verse num="37">It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.</verse>
		<verse num="38">But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.</verse>
		<verse num="39">Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.</verse>
		<verse num="40">Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.</verse>
		<verse num="41">All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.</verse>
		<verse num="42">Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</verse>
		<verse num="43">Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.</verse>
		<verse num="44">Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.</verse>
		<verse num="45">The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.</verse>
		<verse num="46">How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?</verse>
		<verse num="47">Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</verse>
		<verse num="48">What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.</verse>
		<verse num="49">Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?</verse>
		<verse num="50">Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;</verse>
		<verse num="51">Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.</verse>
		<verse num="52">Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.</verse>
