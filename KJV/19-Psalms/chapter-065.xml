		<verse num="3">Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.</verse>

		<verse num="5">By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:</verse>

		<verse num="7">Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.</verse>
