		<verse num="1">The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.</verse>
		<verse num="4">He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.</verse>
		<verse num="6">And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.</verse>
		<verse num="8">I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.</verse>
		<verse num="9">I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.</verse>
		<verse num="10">For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.</verse>
		<verse num="11">I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.</verse>
		<verse num="12">If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</verse>
		<verse num="14">Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:</verse>
		<verse num="15">And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</verse>
		<verse num="16">But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?</verse>
		<verse num="17">Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind thee.</verse>
		<verse num="18">When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.</verse>
		<verse num="21">These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.</verse>
		<verse num="22">Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</verse>
		<verse num="23">Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.</verse>
