		<verse num="1">Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.</verse>
		<verse num="4">For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.</verse>
		<verse num="6">In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</verse>
		<verse num="7">For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.</verse>
		<verse num="9">For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.</verse>
		<verse num="10">The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.</verse>
		<verse num="12">So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</verse>
		<verse num="14">O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.</verse>
		<verse num="17">And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</verse>
