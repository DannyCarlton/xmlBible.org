		<verse num="1">Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.</verse>
		<verse num="3">For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.</verse>
		<verse num="4">My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.</verse>
		<verse num="5">By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.</verse>
		<verse num="6">I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.</verse>
		<verse num="7">I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.</verse>
		<verse num="9">For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</verse>
		<verse num="11">My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.</verse>
		<verse num="12">But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.</verse>
		<verse num="14">For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.</verse>
		<verse num="15">So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</verse>
		<verse num="16">When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.</verse>
		<verse num="17">He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</verse>
		<verse num="18">This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.</verse>
		<verse num="19">For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;</verse>
		<verse num="20">To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;</verse>
		<verse num="21">To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;</verse>
		<verse num="22">When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</verse>
		<verse num="23">He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.</verse>
		<verse num="24">I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.</verse>
		<verse num="25">Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</verse>
		<verse num="26">They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:</verse>
		<verse num="27">But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.</verse>
		<verse num="28">The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.</verse>
