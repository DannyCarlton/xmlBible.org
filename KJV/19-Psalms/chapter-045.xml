		<verse num="1">My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.</verse>
		<verse num="4">And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</verse>
		<verse num="8">All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;</verse>
		<verse num="11">So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.</verse>
		<verse num="12">And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.</verse>
		<verse num="13">The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.</verse>
		<verse num="14">She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.</verse>
		<verse num="15">With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="17">I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.</verse>
