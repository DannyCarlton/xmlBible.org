		<verse num="2">And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.</verse>

		<verse num="4">Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.</verse>
		<verse num="5">I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.</verse>
		<verse num="6">I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.</verse>

		<verse num="10">Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.</verse>

		<verse num="12">And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.</verse>
