		<verse num="1">I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</verse>
		<verse num="2">The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</verse>
		<verse num="3">I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</verse>
		<verse num="4">The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</verse>
		<verse num="5">The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</verse>
		<verse num="6">In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</verse>
		<verse num="8">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</verse>
		<verse num="9">He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.</verse>
		<verse num="10">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</verse>
		<verse num="11">He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</verse>
		<verse num="12">At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.</verse>
		<verse num="13">The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</verse>
		<verse num="16">He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</verse>
		<verse num="17">He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</verse>
		<verse num="18">They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</verse>
		<verse num="19">He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</verse>
		<verse num="20">The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</verse>
		<verse num="21">For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</verse>
		<verse num="22">For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</verse>
		<verse num="23">I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</verse>
		<verse num="24">Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</verse>
		<verse num="25">With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</verse>
		<verse num="26">With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</verse>
		<verse num="27">For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</verse>
		<verse num="28">For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</verse>
		<verse num="29">For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</verse>
		<verse num="30">As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.</verse>
		<verse num="31">For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?</verse>
		<verse num="32">It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</verse>
		<verse num="33">He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.</verse>
		<verse num="34">He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</verse>
		<verse num="35">Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</verse>
		<verse num="36">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</verse>
		<verse num="37">I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</verse>
		<verse num="38">I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</verse>
		<verse num="39">For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</verse>
		<verse num="40">Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</verse>
		<verse num="41">They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</verse>
		<verse num="42">Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</verse>
		<verse num="43">Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</verse>
		<verse num="44">As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</verse>
		<verse num="45">The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</verse>
		<verse num="46">The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</verse>
		<verse num="47">It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</verse>
		<verse num="48">He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</verse>
		<verse num="49">Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</verse>
		<verse num="50">Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</verse>
