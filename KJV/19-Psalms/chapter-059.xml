		<verse num="1">Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.</verse>
		<verse num="3">For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.</verse>
		<verse num="4">They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.</verse>
		<verse num="6">They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?</verse>
		<verse num="8">But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.</verse>
		<verse num="10">The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.</verse>
		<verse num="12">For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.</verse>
		<verse num="14">And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.</verse>
		<verse num="16">But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.</verse>
		<verse num="17">Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.</verse>
