		<verse num="1">O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.</verse>
		<verse num="3">LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?</verse>
		<verse num="4">How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?</verse>
		<verse num="5">They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.</verse>
		<verse num="6">They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?</verse>
		<verse num="9">He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?</verse>
		<verse num="10">He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?</verse>
		<verse num="11">The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;</verse>
		<verse num="13">That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.</verse>
		<verse num="14">For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.</verse>

		<verse num="16">Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?</verse>
		<verse num="17">Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.</verse>
		<verse num="18">When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.</verse>
		<verse num="19">In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?</verse>
		<verse num="21">They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.</verse>
		<verse num="22">But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.</verse>
		<verse num="23">And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.</verse>
