		<verse num="1">Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.</verse>
		<verse num="2">But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</verse>
		<verse num="3">For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</verse>
		<verse num="4">For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.</verse>
		<verse num="5">They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</verse>
		<verse num="8">They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.</verse>
		<verse num="9">They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.</verse>
		<verse num="11">And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</verse>
		<verse num="12">Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</verse>
		<verse num="14">For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</verse>
		<verse num="15">If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.</verse>
		<verse num="16">When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;</verse>
		<verse num="17">Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.</verse>
		<verse num="18">Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</verse>
		<verse num="19">How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</verse>
		<verse num="20">As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</verse>
		<verse num="22">So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.</verse>
		<verse num="23">Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.</verse>
		<verse num="24">Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.</verse>
		<verse num="25">Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.</verse>
		<verse num="26">My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</verse>
		<verse num="27">For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</verse>
		<verse num="28">But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</verse>
