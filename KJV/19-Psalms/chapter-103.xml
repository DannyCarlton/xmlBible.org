		<verse num="1">Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</verse>
		<verse num="3">Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</verse>
		<verse num="4">Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</verse>
		<verse num="5">Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.</verse>
		<verse num="6">The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</verse>
		<verse num="7">He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</verse>
		<verse num="8">The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</verse>
		<verse num="9">He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.</verse>
		<verse num="10">He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</verse>
		<verse num="11">For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</verse>
		<verse num="12">As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.</verse>
		<verse num="14">For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.</verse>
		<verse num="15">As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</verse>
		<verse num="16">For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.</verse>
		<verse num="17">But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;</verse>
		<verse num="18">To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</verse>
		<verse num="19">The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.</verse>
		<verse num="22">Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.</verse>
