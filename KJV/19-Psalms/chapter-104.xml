		<verse num="1">Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:</verse>
		<verse num="3">Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:</verse>
		<verse num="4">Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:</verse>
		<verse num="5">Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.</verse>
		<verse num="7">At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.</verse>
		<verse num="8">They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="10">He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.</verse>
		<verse num="11">They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.</verse>
		<verse num="12">By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.</verse>
		<verse num="13">He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.</verse>
		<verse num="14">He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;</verse>
		<verse num="15">And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.</verse>
		<verse num="16">The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</verse>
		<verse num="17">Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.</verse>
		<verse num="18">The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.</verse>
		<verse num="19">He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.</verse>
		<verse num="21">The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.</verse>
		<verse num="22">The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.</verse>
		<verse num="23">Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</verse>
		<verse num="24">O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.</verse>
		<verse num="25">So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.</verse>
		<verse num="26">There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.</verse>
		<verse num="27">These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.</verse>
		<verse num="28">That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.</verse>
		<verse num="29">Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.</verse>
		<verse num="30">Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="31">The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.</verse>
		<verse num="32">He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</verse>
		<verse num="33">I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</verse>
		<verse num="34">My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.</verse>
		<verse num="35">Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.</verse>
