		<verse num="1">O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</verse>
		<verse num="4">For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?</verse>
		<verse num="8">If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.</verse>
		<verse num="9">If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;</verse>
		<verse num="10">Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</verse>
		<verse num="11">If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.</verse>
		<verse num="13">For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.</verse>
		<verse num="14">I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.</verse>
		<verse num="15">My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.</verse>
		<verse num="17">How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!</verse>
		<verse num="18">If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.</verse>
		<verse num="20">For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</verse>
		<verse num="22">I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.</verse>
		<verse num="23">Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:</verse>
		<verse num="24">And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</verse>
