		<verse num="1">Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</verse>
		<verse num="3">My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</verse>
		<verse num="4">For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</verse>
		<verse num="5">The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</verse>
		<verse num="7">But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</verse>
		<verse num="9">For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</verse>
		<verse num="11">But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</verse>
		<verse num="12">For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.</verse>
