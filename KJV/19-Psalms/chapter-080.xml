		<verse num="1">Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</verse>
		<verse num="4">O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?</verse>
		<verse num="5">Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.</verse>
		<verse num="10">The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.</verse>
		<verse num="11">She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?</verse>

		<verse num="14">Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;</verse>
		<verse num="15">And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.</verse>
		<verse num="16">It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.</verse>
		<verse num="17">Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.</verse>
		<verse num="18">So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</verse>
