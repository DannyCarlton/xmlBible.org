		<verse num="1">Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.</verse>
		<verse num="4">For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.</verse>
		<verse num="5">This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.</verse>
		<verse num="6">I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;</verse>
		<verse num="9">There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.</verse>
		<verse num="10">I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</verse>
		<verse num="11">But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</verse>
		<verse num="12">So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!</verse>
		<verse num="14">I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.</verse>
		<verse num="15">The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.</verse>
		<verse num="16">He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.</verse>
