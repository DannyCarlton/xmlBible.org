		<verse num="1">We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.</verse>
		<verse num="2">How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.</verse>
		<verse num="3">For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.</verse>
		<verse num="6">For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.</verse>
		<verse num="7">But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.</verse>
		<verse num="8">In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.</verse>
		<verse num="9">But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.</verse>
		<verse num="15">My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,</verse>
		<verse num="16">For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.</verse>
		<verse num="17">All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.</verse>
		<verse num="18">Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;</verse>
		<verse num="19">Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.</verse>
		<verse num="20">If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;</verse>
		<verse num="21">Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.</verse>
		<verse num="22">Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</verse>
		<verse num="23">Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.</verse>
		<verse num="24">Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?</verse>
		<verse num="25">For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="26">Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.</verse>
