		<verse num="1">Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.</verse>
		<verse num="2">A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.</verse>
		<verse num="4">If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.</verse>
		<verse num="5">There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:</verse>
		<verse num="6">Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</verse>
		<verse num="7">I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="8">He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</verse>
		<verse num="10">If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</verse>
		<verse num="12">The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</verse>
		<verse num="13">The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</verse>
		<verse num="14">A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</verse>
		<verse num="15">The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!</verse>
		<verse num="17">Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</verse>
		<verse num="18">By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.</verse>
		<verse num="19">A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</verse>
