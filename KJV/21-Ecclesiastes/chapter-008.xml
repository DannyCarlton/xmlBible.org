		<verse num="1">Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</verse>
		<verse num="2">I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</verse>
		<verse num="5">Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.</verse>
		<verse num="7">For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</verse>
		<verse num="8">There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</verse>
		<verse num="9">All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</verse>
		<verse num="10">And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</verse>
		<verse num="13">But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</verse>
		<verse num="14">There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</verse>
		<verse num="16">When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</verse>
		<verse num="17">Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</verse>
