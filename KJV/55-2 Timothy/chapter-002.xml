	<chapter num="2">
		<verse num="1">Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
		<verse num="2">And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
		<verse num="4">No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</verse>
		<verse num="5">And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</verse>
		<verse num="6">The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</verse>
		<verse num="9">Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
		<verse num="11">It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:</verse>
		<verse num="12">If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</verse>
		<verse num="13">If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</verse>
		<verse num="16">But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</verse>
		<verse num="17">And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</verse>
		<verse num="18">Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</verse>
		<verse num="20">But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</verse>
		<verse num="21">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.</verse>
		<verse num="22">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
		<verse num="23">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</verse>
		<verse num="24">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,</verse>
		<verse num="25">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</verse>
		<verse num="26">And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</verse>
