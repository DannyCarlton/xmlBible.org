	<chapter num="4">
		<verse num="1">I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</verse>
		<verse num="2">Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine.</verse>
		<verse num="3">For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</verse>
		<verse num="4">And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</verse>
		<verse num="5">But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</verse>
		<verse num="6">For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</verse>
		<verse num="7">I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</verse>
		<verse num="8">Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</verse>
		<verse num="10">For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</verse>
		<verse num="12">And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</verse>
		<verse num="13">The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</verse>
		<verse num="15">Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</verse>
		<verse num="16">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</verse>
		<verse num="17">Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
		<verse num="18">And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</verse>
		<verse num="22">The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
