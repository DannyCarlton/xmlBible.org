		<verse num="1">Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</verse>
		<verse num="2">But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.</verse>
		<verse num="3">And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</verse>
		<verse num="4">Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</verse>
		<verse num="5">But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</verse>
		<verse num="6">Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</verse>
		<verse num="7">To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</verse>
		<verse num="8">But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,</verse>
		<verse num="9">Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;</verse>
		<verse num="10">But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:</verse>
		<verse num="11">For there is no respect of persons with God.</verse>
		<verse num="12">For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</verse>
		<verse num="13">(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</verse>
		<verse num="14">For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</verse>
		<verse num="15">Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)</verse>
		<verse num="16">In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</verse>
		<verse num="17">Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</verse>
		<verse num="18">And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</verse>
		<verse num="19">And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,</verse>
		<verse num="20">An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</verse>
		<verse num="22">Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</verse>
		<verse num="23">Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?</verse>
		<verse num="24">For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</verse>
		<verse num="25">For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</verse>
		<verse num="26">Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</verse>
		<verse num="27">And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</verse>
		<verse num="28">For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</verse>
		<verse num="29">But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</verse>
