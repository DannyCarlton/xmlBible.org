		<verse num="1">What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</verse>
		<verse num="2">Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</verse>
		<verse num="3">For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</verse>
		<verse num="4">God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</verse>
		<verse num="5">But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</verse>
		<verse num="6">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</verse>
		<verse num="7">For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</verse>
		<verse num="8">And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</verse>
		<verse num="9">What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</verse>
		<verse num="10">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</verse>
		<verse num="11">There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</verse>
		<verse num="12">They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</verse>
		<verse num="14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</verse>
		<verse num="15">Their feet are swift to shed blood:</verse>
		<verse num="16">Destruction and misery are in their ways:</verse>
		<verse num="17">And the way of peace have they not known:</verse>
		<verse num="18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</verse>
		<verse num="21">But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</verse>
		<verse num="22">Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</verse>
		<verse num="23">For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</verse>
		<verse num="24">Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</verse>
		<verse num="25">Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</verse>
		<verse num="26">To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</verse>
		<verse num="27">Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</verse>
		<verse num="28">Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</verse>
		<verse num="29">Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</verse>
		<verse num="30">Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</verse>
		<verse num="31">Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</verse>
