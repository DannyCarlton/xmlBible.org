	<chapter num="35">
		<verse num="1">The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.</verse>
		<verse num="2">It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the excellency of our God.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.</verse>
		<verse num="7">And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.</verse>
		<verse num="8">And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.</verse>
		<verse num="9">No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:</verse>
		<verse num="10">And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</verse>
