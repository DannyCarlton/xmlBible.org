	<chapter num="1">
		<verse num="1">The song of songs, which is Solomon's.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.</verse>
		<verse num="5">I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?</verse>
		<verse num="8">If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.</verse>
		<verse num="9">I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.</verse>
		<verse num="11">We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.</verse>
		<verse num="12">While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.</verse>
		<verse num="13">A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.</verse>
		<verse num="14">My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green.</verse>
		<verse num="17">The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.</verse>
