	<chapter num="8">
		<verse num="1">O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.</verse>
		<verse num="2">I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</verse>
		<verse num="3">His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.</verse>
		<verse num="4">I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</verse>
		<verse num="8">We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</verse>
		<verse num="9">If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.</verse>
		<verse num="10">I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.</verse>
		<verse num="12">My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.</verse>
