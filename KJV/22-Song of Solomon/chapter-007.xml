	<chapter num="7">
		<verse num="1">How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.</verse>
		<verse num="6">How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!</verse>
		<verse num="7">This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.</verse>
		<verse num="8">I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;</verse>
		<verse num="9">And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.</verse>
		<verse num="10">I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.</verse>
		<verse num="13">The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</verse>
