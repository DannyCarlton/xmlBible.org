		<verse num="1">Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.</verse>
		<verse num="2">And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</verse>
		<verse num="3">And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</verse>
		<verse num="4">And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</verse>
		<verse num="5">And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</verse>
		<verse num="6">But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.</verse>
		<verse num="7">And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.</verse>
		<verse num="9">And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;</verse>
		<verse num="10">The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</verse>
		<verse num="11">And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:</verse>
		<verse num="13">And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</verse>
		<verse num="14">And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</verse>
		<verse num="15">Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</verse>
		<verse num="16">These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.</verse>
		<verse num="17">And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.</verse>
		<verse num="18">And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.</verse>
		<verse num="19">And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:</verse>
		<verse num="20">And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.</verse>
		<verse num="21">And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</verse>
		<verse num="22">And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.</verse>
		<verse num="23">And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</verse>
		<verse num="24">And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</verse>
		<verse num="25">And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</verse>
		<verse num="26">And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.</verse>
		<verse num="27">And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.</verse>
		<verse num="28">And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.</verse>
		<verse num="29">And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:</verse>
		<verse num="30">And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</verse>
		<verse num="31">And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</verse>
		<verse num="32">And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?</verse>
		<verse num="33">And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</verse>
		<verse num="34">Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.</verse>
