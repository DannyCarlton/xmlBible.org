		<verse num="1">If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="3">For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</verse>
		<verse num="4">When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</verse>
		<verse num="6">For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</verse>
		<verse num="7">In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.</verse>
		<verse num="8">But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;</verse>
		<verse num="10">And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</verse>
		<verse num="11">Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;</verse>
		<verse num="13">Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.</verse>
		<verse num="14">And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.</verse>
		<verse num="15">And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</verse>
		<verse num="17">And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</verse>
		<verse num="18">Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.</verse>
		<verse num="22">Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;</verse>
		<verse num="23">And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;</verse>
		<verse num="24">Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
		<verse num="25">But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</verse>
