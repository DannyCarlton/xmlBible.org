		<verse num="1">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</verse>
		<verse num="2">In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</verse>
		<verse num="3">But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</verse>
		<verse num="4">To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</verse>
		<verse num="5">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</verse>
		<verse num="6">If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</verse>
		<verse num="7">For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</verse>
		<verse num="8">But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</verse>
		<verse num="9">Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</verse>
		<verse num="10">For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</verse>
		<verse num="11">Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</verse>
		<verse num="12">One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, the Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</verse>
		<verse num="13">This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</verse>
		<verse num="14">Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</verse>
		<verse num="16">They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</verse>
