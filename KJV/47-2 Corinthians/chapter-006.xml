		<verse num="1">We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</verse>
		<verse num="2">(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)</verse>
		<verse num="3">Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:</verse>
		<verse num="4">But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,</verse>
		<verse num="5">In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;</verse>
		<verse num="6">By pureness, by knowledge, by long suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,</verse>
		<verse num="7">By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</verse>
		<verse num="8">By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;</verse>
		<verse num="9">As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;</verse>
		<verse num="10">As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</verse>
		<verse num="11">O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?</verse>
		<verse num="15">And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?</verse>
		<verse num="16">And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</verse>
		<verse num="17">Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.</verse>
		<verse num="18">And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</verse>
