		<verse num="17">And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;</verse>
		<verse num="18">Who hitherto waited in the king's gate eastward: they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi.</verse>
		<verse num="19">And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.</verse>
