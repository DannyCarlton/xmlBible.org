	<chapter num="23">
		<verse num="1">So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.</verse>
		<verse num="2">And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:</verse>
		<verse num="5">Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.</verse>
		<verse num="6">And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.</verse>
		<verse num="8">The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.</verse>
		<verse num="9">The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.</verse>
		<verse num="10">And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.</verse>
		<verse num="11">And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house.</verse>
		<verse num="12">The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</verse>
		<verse num="13">The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.</verse>
		<verse num="15">The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.</verse>
		<verse num="17">And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.</verse>
		<verse num="18">Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.</verse>
		<verse num="21">The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.</verse>
		<verse num="22">And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.</verse>
		<verse num="23">The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.</verse>
		<verse num="24">These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.</verse>
		<verse num="25">For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:</verse>
		<verse num="26">And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.</verse>
		<verse num="27">For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:</verse>
		<verse num="28">Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;</verse>
		<verse num="29">Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;</verse>
		<verse num="30">And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even:</verse>
		<verse num="31">And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD:</verse>
		<verse num="32">And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.</verse>
