		<verse num="1">From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?</verse>
		<verse num="2">Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</verse>
		<verse num="6">But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</verse>
		<verse num="12">There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</verse>
		<verse num="13">Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</verse>
		<verse num="14">Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</verse>
		<verse num="15">For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</verse>
		<verse num="16">But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</verse>
		<verse num="17">Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</verse>
