		<verse num="3">When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.</verse>
		<verse num="4">The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.</verse>
		<verse num="5">It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.</verse>
		<verse num="6">A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.</verse>
		<verse num="7">A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.</verse>
		<verse num="8">The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</verse>
		<verse num="9">He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.</verse>
		<verse num="10">The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</verse>
		<verse num="11">The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.</verse>

		<verse num="18">The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.</verse>
		<verse num="19">A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.</verse>
		<verse num="20">A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</verse>
