		<verse num="1">Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.</verse>
		<verse num="3">A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?</verse>
		<verse num="5">Open rebuke is better than secret love.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.</verse>
		<verse num="7">The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</verse>
		<verse num="8">As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.</verse>
		<verse num="11">My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.</verse>
		<verse num="12">A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</verse>
		<verse num="14">He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.</verse>
		<verse num="15">A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.</verse>
		<verse num="17">Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.</verse>
		<verse num="18">Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.</verse>
		<verse num="19">As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.</verse>
		<verse num="21">As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.</verse>
		<verse num="22">Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.</verse>
		<verse num="23">Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.</verse>
		<verse num="24">For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?</verse>
		<verse num="25">The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.</verse>
		<verse num="26">The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.</verse>
		<verse num="27">And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.</verse>
