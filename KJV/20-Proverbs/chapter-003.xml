		<verse num="1">My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</verse>
		<verse num="2">For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</verse>
		<verse num="4">So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</verse>
		<verse num="6">In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</verse>
		<verse num="8">It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</verse>
		<verse num="10">So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</verse>
		<verse num="11">My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</verse>
		<verse num="12">For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</verse>
		<verse num="14">For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</verse>
		<verse num="15">She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.</verse>
		<verse num="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</verse>
		<verse num="18">She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.</verse>
		<verse num="19">The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</verse>
		<verse num="20">By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</verse>
		<verse num="21">My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</verse>
		<verse num="22">So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</verse>
		<verse num="23">Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</verse>
		<verse num="24">When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</verse>
		<verse num="25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</verse>
		<verse num="26">For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</verse>
		<verse num="27">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</verse>
		<verse num="28">Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</verse>
		<verse num="29">Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</verse>
		<verse num="30">Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</verse>
		<verse num="31">Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</verse>
		<verse num="32">For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.</verse>
		<verse num="33">The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</verse>
		<verse num="34">Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</verse>
		<verse num="35">The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</verse>
