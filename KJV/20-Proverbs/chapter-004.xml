		<verse num="1">Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</verse>
		<verse num="2">For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</verse>
		<verse num="3">For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</verse>
		<verse num="4">He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</verse>
		<verse num="9">She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</verse>
		<verse num="11">I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.</verse>
		<verse num="12">When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</verse>
		<verse num="16">For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</verse>
		<verse num="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</verse>
		<verse num="18">But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</verse>
		<verse num="19">The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</verse>
		<verse num="20">My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</verse>
		<verse num="22">For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</verse>
		<verse num="23">Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.</verse>
		<verse num="24">Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.</verse>
		<verse num="25">Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</verse>
		<verse num="26">Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.</verse>
		<verse num="27">Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.</verse>
