	<chapter num="9">
		<verse num="1">Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:</verse>
		<verse num="2">She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.</verse>
		<verse num="3">She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,</verse>
		<verse num="4">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</verse>
		<verse num="5">Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.</verse>
		<verse num="7">He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</verse>
		<verse num="10">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.</verse>
		<verse num="11">For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</verse>
		<verse num="12">If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.</verse>
		<verse num="13">A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.</verse>
		<verse num="14">For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</verse>
		<verse num="15">To call passengers who go right on their ways:</verse>
		<verse num="16">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</verse>
		<verse num="17">Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.</verse>
		<verse num="18">But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.</verse>
