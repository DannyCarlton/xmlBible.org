	<chapter num="30">
		<verse num="1">The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,</verse>
		<verse num="2">Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.</verse>
		<verse num="3">I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?</verse>
		<verse num="5">Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:</verse>
		<verse num="8">Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</verse>
		<verse num="9">Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.</verse>
		<verse num="11">There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</verse>
		<verse num="12">There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.</verse>
		<verse num="13">There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.</verse>
		<verse num="14">There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.</verse>
		<verse num="15">The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:</verse>
		<verse num="16">The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.</verse>
		<verse num="17">The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</verse>
		<verse num="18">There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:</verse>
		<verse num="19">The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.</verse>
		<verse num="20">Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</verse>
		<verse num="21">For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:</verse>
		<verse num="22">For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;</verse>
		<verse num="23">For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</verse>
		<verse num="24">There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:</verse>
		<verse num="25">The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</verse>
		<verse num="26">The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</verse>
		<verse num="27">The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</verse>
		<verse num="28">The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.</verse>
		<verse num="29">There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:</verse>
		<verse num="30">A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;</verse>
		<verse num="31">A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.</verse>
		<verse num="32">If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.</verse>
		<verse num="33">Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</verse>
