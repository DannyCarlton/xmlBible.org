		<verse num="1">The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.</verse>
		<verse num="2">What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?</verse>
		<verse num="3">Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</verse>
		<verse num="4">It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:</verse>
		<verse num="5">Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.</verse>
		<verse num="11">The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</verse>
		<verse num="12">She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</verse>
		<verse num="13">She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</verse>
		<verse num="14">She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</verse>
		<verse num="15">She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</verse>
		<verse num="16">She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</verse>
		<verse num="17">She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.</verse>
		<verse num="18">She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.</verse>
		<verse num="19">She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</verse>
		<verse num="20">She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</verse>
		<verse num="21">She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</verse>
		<verse num="22">She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.</verse>
		<verse num="23">Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</verse>
		<verse num="24">She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</verse>
		<verse num="25">Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</verse>
		<verse num="26">She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.</verse>
		<verse num="27">She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</verse>
		<verse num="28">Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.</verse>
		<verse num="29">Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</verse>
		<verse num="30">Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</verse>
		<verse num="31">Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.</verse>
