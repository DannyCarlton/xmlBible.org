		<verse num="1">In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</verse>
		<verse num="2">And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</verse>
		<verse num="3">His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</verse>
		<verse num="4">And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</verse>
		<verse num="5">And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</verse>
		<verse num="6">He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</verse>
		<verse num="7">And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</verse>
		<verse num="8">And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</verse>
		<verse num="9">And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</verse>
		<verse num="12">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</verse>
		<verse num="13">Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</verse>
		<verse num="14">And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</verse>
		<verse num="15">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</verse>
		<verse num="17">And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</verse>
		<verse num="18">And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</verse>
		<verse num="19">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</verse>
		<verse num="20">Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</verse>
