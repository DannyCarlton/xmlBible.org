	<chapter num="8">
		<verse num="1">When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.</verse>
		<verse num="2">And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</verse>
		<verse num="3">And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
		<verse num="4">And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</verse>
		<verse num="5">And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,</verse>
		<verse num="6">And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.</verse>
		<verse num="7">And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.</verse>
		<verse num="8">The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.</verse>
		<verse num="9">For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</verse>
		<verse num="10">When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</verse>
		<verse num="11">And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
		<verse num="12">But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
		<verse num="13">And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.</verse>
		<verse num="14">And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.</verse>
		<verse num="15">And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.</verse>
		<verse num="16">When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:</verse>
		<verse num="17">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.</verse>
		<verse num="18">Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.</verse>
		<verse num="19">And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</verse>
		<verse num="20">And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</verse>
		<verse num="21">And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</verse>
		<verse num="22">But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.</verse>
		<verse num="23">And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.</verse>
		<verse num="24">And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.</verse>
		<verse num="25">And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.</verse>
		<verse num="26">And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.</verse>
		<verse num="27">But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!</verse>
		<verse num="28">And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.</verse>
		<verse num="29">And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</verse>
		<verse num="30">And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.</verse>
		<verse num="31">So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.</verse>
		<verse num="32">And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.</verse>
		<verse num="33">And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.</verse>
		<verse num="34">And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.</verse>
