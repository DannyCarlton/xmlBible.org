		<verse num="1">And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</verse>
		<verse num="2">And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;</verse>
		<verse num="3">And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</verse>
		<verse num="4">That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</verse>
		<verse num="5">And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</verse>
		<verse num="6">And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</verse>
		<verse num="8">And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
		<verse num="10">And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</verse>
		<verse num="11">And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</verse>
		<verse num="12">In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</verse>
		<verse num="13">For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</verse>
		<verse num="14">And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</verse>
		<verse num="15">And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.</verse>
		<verse num="17">And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</verse>
		<verse num="18">And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</verse>
		<verse num="19">And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</verse>
		<verse num="20">And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</verse>
		<verse num="21">And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</verse>
