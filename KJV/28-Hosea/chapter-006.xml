	<chapter num="6">
		<verse num="1">Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</verse>
		<verse num="2">After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="4">O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.</verse>
		<verse num="6">For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</verse>
		<verse num="7">But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.</verse>
		<verse num="9">And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.</verse>
		<verse num="10">I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.</verse>
