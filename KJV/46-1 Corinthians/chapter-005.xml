		<verse num="1">It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</verse>
		<verse num="2">And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</verse>
		<verse num="3">For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,</verse>
		<verse num="4">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
		<verse num="5">To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</verse>
		<verse num="7">Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</verse>
		<verse num="8">Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
		<verse num="9">I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</verse>
		<verse num="10">Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</verse>
		<verse num="11">But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</verse>
		<verse num="12">For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?</verse>
		<verse num="13">But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</verse>
