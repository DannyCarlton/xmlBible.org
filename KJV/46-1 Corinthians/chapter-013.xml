	<chapter num="13">
		<verse num="1">Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</verse>
		<verse num="2">And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</verse>
		<verse num="3">And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</verse>
		<verse num="4">Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</verse>
		<verse num="5">Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;</verse>
		<verse num="6">Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;</verse>
		<verse num="7">Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.</verse>
		<verse num="9">For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</verse>
		<verse num="10">But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.</verse>
		<verse num="11">When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</verse>
		<verse num="12">For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.</verse>
		<verse num="13">And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.</verse>
