	<chapter num="9">
		<verse num="1">Am I am not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?</verse>
		<verse num="2">If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,</verse>
		<verse num="4">Have we not power to eat and to drink?</verse>
		<verse num="5">Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</verse>
		<verse num="6">Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?</verse>
		<verse num="7">Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</verse>
		<verse num="8">Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?</verse>
		<verse num="9">For it is written in the law of Moses, thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?</verse>
		<verse num="10">Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.</verse>
		<verse num="11">If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</verse>
		<verse num="12">If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?</verse>
		<verse num="14">Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</verse>
		<verse num="15">But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</verse>
		<verse num="16">For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!</verse>
		<verse num="17">For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.</verse>
		<verse num="18">What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</verse>
		<verse num="19">For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</verse>
		<verse num="20">And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</verse>
		<verse num="21">To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.</verse>
		<verse num="22">To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.</verse>
		<verse num="23">And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.</verse>
		<verse num="24">Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</verse>
		<verse num="25">And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</verse>
		<verse num="26">I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:</verse>
		<verse num="27">But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</verse>
