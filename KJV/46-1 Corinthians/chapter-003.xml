		<verse num="1">And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.</verse>
		<verse num="2">I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</verse>
		<verse num="3">For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</verse>
		<verse num="4">For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</verse>
		<verse num="5">Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</verse>
		<verse num="6">I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</verse>
		<verse num="7">So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</verse>
		<verse num="9">For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.</verse>
		<verse num="10">According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</verse>
		<verse num="11">For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</verse>
		<verse num="13">Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</verse>
		<verse num="14">If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
		<verse num="15">If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</verse>
		<verse num="17">If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</verse>
		<verse num="18">Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</verse>
		<verse num="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</verse>
		<verse num="20">And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
		<verse num="21">Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;</verse>
		<verse num="22">Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's;</verse>
		<verse num="23">And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</verse>
