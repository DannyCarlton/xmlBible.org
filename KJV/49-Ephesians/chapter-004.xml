		<verse num="1">I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,</verse>
		<verse num="2">With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;</verse>
		<verse num="3">Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
		<verse num="4">There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;</verse>
		<verse num="5">One Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
		<verse num="6">One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</verse>
		<verse num="7">But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</verse>
		<verse num="9">(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
		<verse num="10">He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)</verse>
		<verse num="11">And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</verse>
		<verse num="12">For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</verse>
		<verse num="13">Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</verse>
		<verse num="14">That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</verse>
		<verse num="15">But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:</verse>
		<verse num="16">From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.</verse>
		<verse num="17">This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,</verse>
		<verse num="18">Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:</verse>
		<verse num="19">Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</verse>
		<verse num="20">But ye have not so learned Christ;</verse>
		<verse num="21">If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:</verse>
		<verse num="22">That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;</verse>
		<verse num="23">And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;</verse>
		<verse num="24">And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</verse>
		<verse num="25">Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.</verse>
		<verse num="26">Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:</verse>
		<verse num="27">Neither give place to the devil.</verse>
		<verse num="28">Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</verse>
		<verse num="29">Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.</verse>
		<verse num="30">And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</verse>
		<verse num="31">Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:</verse>
		<verse num="32">And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.</verse>
