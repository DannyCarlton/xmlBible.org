	<chapter num="5">
		<verse num="1">Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</verse>
		<verse num="2">And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</verse>
		<verse num="3">But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</verse>
		<verse num="4">Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</verse>
		<verse num="5">For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</verse>
		<verse num="8">For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</verse>
		<verse num="9">(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</verse>
		<verse num="10">Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</verse>
		<verse num="11">And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</verse>
		<verse num="12">For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</verse>
		<verse num="13">But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</verse>
		<verse num="14">Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</verse>
		<verse num="15">See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</verse>
		<verse num="16">Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
		<verse num="17">Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.</verse>
		<verse num="18">And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</verse>
		<verse num="19">Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</verse>
		<verse num="20">Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
		<verse num="21">Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</verse>
		<verse num="22">Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</verse>
		<verse num="23">For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</verse>
		<verse num="24">Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</verse>
		<verse num="25">Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;</verse>
		<verse num="26">That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,</verse>
		<verse num="27">That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</verse>
		<verse num="28">So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</verse>
		<verse num="29">For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:</verse>
		<verse num="30">For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</verse>
		<verse num="31">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</verse>
		<verse num="32">This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</verse>
		<verse num="33">Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.</verse>
